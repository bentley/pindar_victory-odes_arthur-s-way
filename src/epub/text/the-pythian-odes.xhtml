					<p epub:type="bridgehead">For Hiero, ruler of Syracuse, on his victory in the chariot-race, 470 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>, in which he was proclaimed as “of Etna,” a new city founded by him near <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Etna. In 480 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> he had defeated the Carthaginian invaders in the battle of Himera, and in 474 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>, the Etruscans in a sea-fight of Cumae. In <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 475 there was a great eruption of <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Etna. All these events are referred to in this Ode.</p>
