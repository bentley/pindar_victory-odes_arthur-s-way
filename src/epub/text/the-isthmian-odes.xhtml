					<p epub:type="bridgehead">For Kleandros of Aegina, on his victory in the boys’ Pankration, <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 478 (?).

					<p>
						<span>For Kleandros and his comrades, O ye youths, let some of you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go and stand before his father Telesarchus’ gleaming door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wake the chant, the recompense for toils, his glorious due</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the crowns that from the Isthmus and from Nemea he bore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What though I be stricken-hearted, to their praying have I hearkened,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on the golden Muse I call. From night of woes that darkened</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around us are we rescued, and we may not brook bereaving</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of triumph-crowns, nor over cureless evils linger grieving.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But let us cheer the people with the sweetness of our song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though the pain have scarce departed; for the stone that hung so long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above our heads⁠—a very stone of Tantalus⁠—at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A God hath turned aside: the peril now is overpast,</span>

						<span>That intolerable curse unto Hellas! But the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of terror hath departed, and the crushing load of care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is lifted. Yet ’tis better evermore to keep in sight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The perils that be waiting in the path whereon we fare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Time is dogging mortals’ steps, with treacherous feet on-stealing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tangling all the ways of life. Yet even here is healing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For such as have but freedom. Let us still to hope be clinging!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Thebe seven-gated nursed, the Graces’ flowers of singing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I needs must give Aegina; for Asopus’ daughters twain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found favour in the sight of Zeus who over all doth reign.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one of these by lovely-flowered Dirke’s fair demesne</span>

						<span>How that Destiny ordained it that the Lady of the Sea</span>

						<span>Or the trident, were she wedded with any lord of Heaven:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Cease to contend! In marriage to a mortal be she given.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>In war! I give my counsel that this honour from on high</span>
